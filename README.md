## Project 1: Quadcopter Drone Flight Controller
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Description
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

### Critical Path

Project components and/or stages/milestones the success of the project depends on securing.

1. Understanding the drone.
   - (easy) watch the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4L7czrqbS7ebMf5dX5L1SQ)  
   - (medium) learn to fly the drone to understand what you are working on  
   - (medium) follow the [instructor's manual](https://www.dronaaviation.com/learn-instructors-manual/)  
   - (medium/hard) [program](https://create.dronaaviation.com/software) the drone (e.g. some of the tinkerer projects described by the vendor)  
   - (hard) read and understand the [firmware source code](https://github.com/DronaAviation/Magis)    
   - (medium/hard) fly the drone after tinkering with the code  
   - (medium/hard) study the [flight controller](https://create.dronaaviation.com/hardware/flight-controllers/primus-x) along with the firmware to understand what does what     
2. Understanding the [Arduino Babo 33 BLE Sense](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense).
   - (easy/medium) familiarize yourself with the [NINA-B3 documentation](https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/NINA-B3_DataSheet_%28UBX-17052099%29.pdf)  
   - (easy/medium) familiarize yourself with the [nRF52840 documentation](https://content.arduino.cc/assets/Nano_BLE_MCU-nRF52840_PS_v1.1.pdf)  
   - (easy/medium) familiarize yourself with the [sensor suite documentation](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense) (tab _Tech Specs_)  
   - (easy/medium) familiarize yourself with the [board documentation](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense) (tab _Documentation_)       
   - (medium) familiarize yourself with the connectivity of the board, specifically for your project  
3. Flight controller board.
   - (medium) design the flight controller board with all the components that you will need  
   - (medium/hard) design the mounting of the board on the Pluto X frame  
   - (medium) securing the Pluto X, control the motors with your FC board  
4. 3-axis (roll, pitch, yaw) PID loop.
   - (hard) fine-tuning will require an ingenuous "dry-fly" platform, where the drone is secure but still able to move (e.g. the drone suspended by 4 stretched rubber bands)  
   - (medium/hard) manual tuning might never converge, so you have to look for a config file that works for the Pluto X to use as a default, baseline, and starting point for fine tuning   
   - (medium) test the responsiveness of the drone with 3 axes (**critical** to know if the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense will be able to fly the drone)  
5. Control loop.
   - (medium) study how the commands for the Pluto X are actually implemented in firmware  
   - (hard) write your own control loop framework (you might need to limit the scope of the flight capabilities just to keep this possible)  
   - (hard) dry-fly test on your tuning platform  
6. Remote control with BLE.
   - (medium) establish communication over BLE between the Arduino and a mobile phone   
   - (medium/hard) design the BLE app (you might need to start from a skeleton app that you find out there; also, you should scope down from multi-platform to single-platform (whatever your phone is running, just to keep this possible) for the subset of commands you will want to program in the drone and whatever telemetry (real-time data from the drone) you will want to receive  
   - (hard) put the drone in the tuning platform and test the remote control from the app (app->(BLE)->Arduino->(pins)->ESCs+motors)  
7. Safety.
   - (medium) establish minimum distance for safe remote control  
   - (hard) hard-code safe autonomous ascent and descent   
8. Open-air test.  
   

## Project 2: Quadcopter Drone Control with Motion Sensing
